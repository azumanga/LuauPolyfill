## Who created this?

LuauPolyfill was created by engineers at Roblox Corporation to assist with upstreams of popular Javascript tools, such as React, GraphQL, and ApolloGraphQL. However, it can be used by anyone if they so desire. This was released to Github due to it being relatively unknown and that some developers may find it useful.

## How do I install this?
To install this, you will need [Rojo](https://rojo.space) or [Foreman](https://github.com/roblox/foreman). Optionally, if you are a Roblox engineer or user who has Rotriever, support for that has been added too.

Wally and Selene support will be added soon.

To install this with Rojo, take a look at [place.project.json](https://github.com/azumanga/LuauPolyfill/blob/production/place.project.json) and build a place in Rojo with it. Install it from Foreman via the foreman.toml file.
